# Fractoll
***Fractoll by vmazurok (Valentine Mazurok) ***
<hr> 
Second Project of Computer Graphic branch in UNIT Factory.
The goal was to create program what can display some set of fractals, and make the infinite zoom in, using just pure C and minilibX Framework for visualization (primitive window and set points in certain positions).

<b> How to use </b>

In MAC OS, open the folder in terminal, type `make` then execute the binary `fractoll`with number of fractal by first parameter. Example : `./fractoll 1` - shows the Mandelbrot's set. </p>
Execution without parameters shows `usage`. </p>
Executable binary also included in repo.

<b> Ð¡ontrols </b>
```
Right mouse button/ wheel down :  zoom out 
Left mouse button/ wheel up    :  zoom in
Arrow keys                     :  for move the camera
Z / X                          :  change coloring
```
<b> Kinds of fractals  </b>
>> 1.Mandelbrot </p>
>> 2.Julia</p>
>> 3.Ship Fractol</p>
>> etc. </p>

***Julia family sets***
Julia family sets also react on mouse movement by changing it's constants.
